            Generally, Riverhouse takes a hybrid approach that combines
            performance-based Apex development with declarative/no-code
            elements. Every consulting firm would/should take this approach;
            however, it’s dogma with us and we will always tip the solution
            architecture in favor of No-Code elements such as Flow, Process
            Builder, and Lightning App Builder. This approach ensures that
            development time is minimized while also allowing for agile
            responses to changing needs. It’s a holistic approach to application
            design that optimizes the platform’s potential, while maintaining
            performance and scalability.

            What is a No-Code solution? In a Salesforce context, ‘No-Code’
            refers to customizing the behavior of your org without using Apex.
            Using Apex is excellent when the solution requires it, but it comes
            with dependencies that can delay your project and add cost.No-Code
            declarative tools like Salesforce Flow, Process Builder, and
            Lightning App Builder are used to design workflows, build user
            interfaces, and automate processes through a visual interface,
            making it accessible to non-developers. No test cases or minimum
            test coverage is required. These end-user friendly tools not only
            provide broad customization capabilities but also the advantage of
            being user-friendly, requiring minimal technical skills and having a
            large support community. Your team can, in time, easily adapt
            Salesforce to your unique needs, without the need for coding
            expertise.

            A Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) is a modern,
            standards-based framework for building dynamic user interfaces. LWC
            uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create fast and efficient
            components with beautiful user interfaces, delivering superior
            performance and seamless integration with other web-based resources.
            Lightning Web Components can be deployed in your org or on your
            Community (Digital Experience). Salesforce Digital Experiences are
            web portals, bolted on to the side of your Salesforce org, that
            integrate with your org’s CRM data and take advantage of Salesforce
            automation tools. Community customers often to use them as a product
            or task centric online portal facilitating secure, interactive, and
            tailored engagement between businesses, clients, and partners.
